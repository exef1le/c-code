Welcome to the Simple C Programming Tasks project! Here you will find a collection of tasks with code examples in the C programming language that can be helpful for learning or practicing.

## Description

This project is created to provide beginners in programming with the opportunity to apply their knowledge in practical C programming tasks. The tasks are divided into different levels of difficulty, allowing you to gradually progress from simple to more complex concepts and algorithms.

Each task comes with a detailed description of the requirements and examples of expected output. You can use these tasks for self-study or within educational programs.

## How to Use

In this repository, you will find files with C programming tasks. You can browse the code directly here on GitHub and copy it to your own project.

Each task is contained in a separate file with the `.c` extension. To view the code, simply open the respective file in the repository and copy its contents.

## All Codes with Answers
**There will be links for the 6th contest you can look at or download them**<br>

<style>
